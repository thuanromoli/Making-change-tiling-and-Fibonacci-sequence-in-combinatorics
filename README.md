<h1>Making change, tiling, and Fibonacci’s sequence in combinatorics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

The aim of this project is to explore how different problems in the real-world can be represented by the same combinatorial problem. In particular, we will look at three problems and how they are related to each other: Making change, tiling, and Fibonacci’s sequence.
